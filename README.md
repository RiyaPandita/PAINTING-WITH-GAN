# PAINTING WITH GAN

This project demonstrates how to build and train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating images of oil-painted portraits. GANs are a type of unsupervised learning model that learn to capture patterns in data and generate new samples that resemble the original dataset. The dataset used here consists of portraits with varying orientations and poses, making the task challenging but interesting.
